- 👋 Hi, I’m @panson915
- 👀 I’m interested in a little of a lot. Always been interested in all this IT stuff. I am a noob. Starting out in this late in life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of linux. I just created a RPi4. So that was kind of difficult.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on what ever I can. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
